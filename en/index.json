They get the environment offered by adults, where they extract their information and behavior patterns. You can’t, for example, tell your child to be more empathetic, proactive, or sociable if you’re not. I mean you could, but the effect will be short or not at all. He needs a consistent behavioral example, in the desired direction, for long term results. Of course, it can be another family member or educator, teacher, coach…, who has a beneficial influence on the child, but also, in this case, the parent is who offered him the environment.\nIt is never too late in the education process It is very important to understand that in the education process it is never late. All it takes is the right attitude, desire for change, and development. The idea that you can’t make things right anymore doesn’t have to exist. If you have a small child, just start being the best version of yourself. To an older child, you have to explain the changes you make and why. Explain to him that you realized you’ve worked wrong in certain areas of life and want to improve them. That you want him, the child, to do it better than you do. You may need to apologize for certain behaviors and explain to him that you didn’t realize or otherwise you didn’t know how, but now you understand. You don’t have to be afraid to speak honestly to the child, he will feel the sincerity and the impact of the lesson will be even greater.\nEliminate limiting beliefs Once parents broaden their perspective and expand their limits, the children substitute that goal very quickly. They are like a vacuum just waiting to fill. Curiosity is natural and wants to continually conquer new territories.\nThe conclusion is, if you want children free, open-minded and happy, release yourself first, be open to change, don’t stop learning, and create your ability to be happy.\nPhoto credit: Tany Minds\n","id":2,"image":"images/blog/no-limits-children-parents.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"The environment offered to the child is fundamental When parents have certain fears, limiting beliefs, children can’t be otherwise.

Maybe someone says he lost his happiness but even in this case it wasn’t his. He probably put his happiness in something else or someone else, and with the disappearance of the external factor, the well-being also disappeared.\nThat happiness is not yours, it is your happiness that fills your soul every time you feel good. When you feel comfortable when you enjoy what you see, hear, feel. When your mind is free enough to be filled with joy. You can be happy alone or with someone. You can be happy when it’s hot or when it’s cool. You can be happy when you drink water or coffee. It is important not to correlate happiness with something or someone.\nChemical process? It is good to realize that happiness is not a whole or something continuous but pieces of joys, pleasures, beauties, relaxations. More pragmatically, happiness is the consequence of chemical processes in our brains\r. When we understand this we will understand that we can be happy even in difficult times. There is no need to separate: we are happy or we find it difficult. If in the harder times we will not allow ourselves to be happy, we will pass them more difficult, or not at all. I think we all know at least one chronically dissatisfied person. These people cannot get out of these states if they do not allow happiness to be part of the routine.\nMy message is to allow well-being to enter into all the little things we do every day. They will anoint the wheels of life that will move much more harmoniously among the other challenges.\nHappiness is a skill We must not wait for the day when the great happiness will descend upon us with all the joys of life and will never end. We have to make ourselves small joys, escapades in nature, even for a day. Daily walks that start those chemical processes in the body and give us well-being. If we wait for that 10-day vacation once a year, without relaxing, we can no longer enjoy it. We forget what it’s like to be happy and we find what we don’t like there too. Happiness must be practiced consistently and perseveringly, like any other skill you have, if you want to be able to do it excellently.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":3,"image":"images/blog/about-happiness.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"Stop looking for happiness because no one lost it, in any case yours.

The first sight is a total chaos. Companies are turning to online, some know how to do, others not so much. Online course companies are starting to compete with every second specialist who became a teacher overnight. It seems that the pandemic of information is growing exponentially with each new course, than that related to COVID-19. It seems that the world has begun to learn more, but rather it has begun to teach others more. We do not know yet if this formula means even better.\nEconomic crisis? Most interesting, however, remains the topic – the economic crisis. Which is highly promoted by experts. Opinions fluctuate from the extreme crisis compared to 2008\r, until there will be a short-term crisis without serious consequences.\nIf we look closely we will notice that those who were already in crisis, almost bankrupt, gave up first, for them this is a gift, they dismiss the staff motivated. They received some help from the state and are satisfied, even if publicly lamented.\nThose who have worked consistently at its companies have oriented quickly, some have also gone online, others have made new product lines that are required on the market now, and others have reserves for risk situations.\nThere is also the category of those who have been waiting for the crisis\rfor 4, 5 years. They think things will happen as in books. They want to speculate on the effects of the crisis. They insist fiercely that will be a big crisis, and seek to influence others by any means to speed up the process.\nThere are also the undecided, they are trying to find a landmark so they can choose the right direction, but they cannot find any data that will convince them that it will be one way or another.\nCan the economic crisis be foreseen? Unfortunately or fortunately you cannot predict how it will be, because there are many influencing factors: how long the pandemic will last, what reserves the companies have, how they will act on price policies, how much patience will the stock market investors have, those in the real estate markets. No crisis could have been predicted in advance throughout history. Yes, in retrospect they were analyzed and the factors that led to the crisis were found, even though some factors could not be predicted\rin any way, they were factors that did not have a direct connection with a possible crisis.\nWhat are we doing now? Now is the time to learn to live in constant change without being shattered by the feeling of insecurity for tomorrow. To learn to act in extreme situations. Learning to maintain a productive attitude even if everything seems to stand still. Let us draw conclusions that we can pass on to future generations. And not only about the economy and the financial safety net that everyone should have for at least a year before, but also about attitude, kindness, reciprocity, prevention… About the messages that have to be transmitted to others in difficult times, encouraging messages, full of hope, which would help them get out of the negative states that they have. Not to sow fear, panic, discouragement that push people to do hasty actions, to their disadvantage, but to the direct advantage of the crisis.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":4,"image":"images/blog/economic-crisis-business-romania.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"Economic crisis?

But most people are afraid of more than an uncertain future. Many are trying to guess what will happen to the economy, most are based on business cycles, which, to some extent, can really show us how the economy is responding to crises. But it is not taken into account that today there are more informed people and the curves may look completely different because they will react knowingly ( I do not suppose that many people really know the economic cycles and the mechanisms behind them, but they know that in crisis they can buy cheap and sell expensive later). It is not taken into account that the economic instability of this period is not a natural one but as a result of a major force. Nor is the fact that access to information, including economic information, is much easier. Let’s imagine a scenario. People who wanted to buy their homes will postpone when the eventual crisis comes.\nLet’s imagine a scenario. People who wanted to buy houses postponed for when the crisis would come. In this sense, the real estate developers are also expect, and they do not change the prices, waiting for better times, however it is not sold what is the sense to make cheaper. And if everyone is waiting, why not keep their homes and sell them more expensive later. And without worry, they will find what to deal with at this time, one of the ideas would be to rent the homes they own, with a small investment in furniture. But given the fact that they are entrepreneurs, they will find many other things to do. One day those who didn’t buy houses and most likely rented to those developers who were more patient will realize that they are paying rent instead of paying for their own home. They will decide to buy it and since there will be many who will do so, demand will be high, so developers will even increase prices. And let’s not forget about the rent money our clients lost during this time.\nIt’s an imagined scenario, but given the fact that information is circulating much easier today, and people have access to data they never dreamed of, it is likely.\nCrisis strategies are only valid when very few people know them, if many people apply them, even if erratically, the results can be reversed or they may take a completely new twist.\nMankind has come back from much more serious crises over time. I don’t think we have to tremble for fear for tomorrow, this can’t help us. We better use this time to revise our lives. To communicate with loved ones. To analyze and draw conclusions from the created situation. To learn and plan. To meet the new self who is more experienced, more mature, going through a possibly unique period in life. This Period that does not whisper to them, but yells at him that life has a stopping point, and can have many ups and downs. It is important to learn how to climb back as fast as possible, and less wrinkled.\nNow let us imagine that everyone, but everyone, would react more consciously during this period. True feerie what more… I just wanted to imagine :D\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":5,"image":"images/blog/crisis-iminent-uncertainity.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"I would tend to say that people are more afraid of the danger of the present, which is true for part of humanity, those who do not have the habit to think about consequences.","tags":null,"title":"Crisis? – Why are people more afraid, imminent danger or uncertainty of the future?","uri":"/en/blog/crisis-iminent-uncertainity/","year":"2020"},{"content":"When my heart beats more powerfully, I know I live. When the emotions are screaming at me, I am angry at them too, to temper a little. This strategy does not work, which is why I take them with the good. In turn, they start to tell me why they are so upset and why they behave badly with me. They most often occur when I am not fully aware of the situation, or when I am taken by surprise.\nI like to keep my life and the things that happen to me under control. Most often, however, the plans do not totally coincide with reality. Then I come face to face with the astonishment that most often turns into frustration.\nHow is it possible to be taken by surprise if you always planned, planned, planned?\nSimple, you always use the same premises, knowledge and experiences. You want to plan the future using data from the past. And because the development of the society is not just about you…. Surprise!\nThis in itself cannot be changed. You can only change the attitude with which you receive change in your life. You want to reconcile with this reality. Of course you will have to do some convincing work with your beliefs. You will need to analyze them a bit and remove the beliefs that suggest that change is a bad thing. Because it is very likely that you wrote in the genes “change is bad, stay away from it”, “it is good as it is now, you feel comfortable, even if you are not satisfied with what is happening in your life”, “it is better sparrow in hand than crow from the fence” or other words that make you feel good for the moment.\nAt first it is hard, but with the experience you will look forward to something new, something that will move your heart out of place. I liked the words of FedEx founder, president and CEO Fred Smith: “You are the way you are because you want to be that way. If you really wanted to be different, you would already be in the process of change.”\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":6,"image":"images/blog/about-change-when-emotions-scream-at-me.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"When my heart beats more powerfully, I know I live.

I realized how big the number is, only when I wrote it. But I’m not scared. Rather, I feel liberated. Freed from the world’s opinion, as to who I am or not, from the standards that I have created myself. Now, it seems, I have allowed the quiet to enter me, early enough to say that I have found inner peace, from where I know when it comes and stays forever, ssst … not to frighten it. In other years I was thinking about what I could not do, what I want, what I need. Today I am more zen, I hope to stay.\nI realize that I have many projects to finish, others to start, learn, experiment, but today it does not overwhelm me, I just know what I have to do, and that’s all. I know that not everything will work as I think, I know that I will face many challenges, but it does not scare the unknown as much as before. Honestly, I’m just starting to like the fact that I don’t know how things are going to happen.\nI’m starting to reconcile with the idea that it doesn’t crack where I hit. I noticed that crack where it should, not where I think it should. We think we know what we want, but I’ve had indications regularly that it’s not the case. I have the impression that the subconscious always puts his tail in the affairs of the conscious, and destroys his plans made according to social norms, integrated in our head during the educational process given by parents, relatives, neighbors, school and so on. And the most interesting thing is that if you do not complaining that did not happen as you wanted, but you adapt the plans to the created situations, something much bigger, better and more beautiful comes out that you wanted from the beginning.\nI also noticed that you can make a good decision when you are ready. It sounds like cliché, but that’s how it happens, until you really get true understanding under your skin, you have neither the ability nor the courage to play big. You’re doing, certainly, but you don’t have the results you want.\nI thought that if you have a certain opinion about a thing, it will remain forever and it is not fair to change it. I don’t believe that anymore. It’s normal to find new information, to understand it from other perspectives. You have the right and it is really welcome to adapt your opinion, otherwise you will stagnate.\nI also got comfortable with my madness, allowing him from time to time to participate in decision making. It is so much more interesting and cheerful, than keeping it in the dark, so it tan, it takes its vitamin D intake and a mouthful of fresh air.\nYou begin to understand the meaning of the phrase “you will grow bigger and you will understand”. I thought it was about age and I didn’t have the right to know. No … it was about experience, real, I couldn’t really understand then. We know a lot of information, we can tell them in the middle of the night, if someone asks us, but it does not mean we understand them. I realize that I still have a lot to grow 🙂\nP.S.

We know what will happen in the next moment, we know what the other will say, we know if we are going to hit it or not. Why? Because we always look at previous experiences. To be an expert in statistics you have to do years of studies. But we have it in the blood.\nWe put our past experiences as a curtain behind which we cannot see. We can’t stop for a moment, to give ourselves a chance to change. To bring another result. We put clichés on everything that moves. From children, work, dear people, to the fact that milk will burn.\nWe do not allow people around us to change their behavior by labeling them. Rather than crossing our statistical analysis barrier, they give up, because it’s easier.\nWhat if every new day we do not fill it in the morning, with what we know will happen. What if the day is like a clean sheet, and we will complete it, only after one thing or another will happen. How transformative it would be if, speaking to someone, we listened to it breathless, without even having a predefined thought about what would communicate to us. How interesting it is not to put words in the mouths of others, because we think we know what he will say, “that he usually says so”.\nCertainly we will find out new things about the person in front, we will see that it is not as we always thought. We will realize that people have many sides, besides being quiet they can be very determined or besides energetic they can be very profound.\nIf we make the pattern of people and situations of the day, we already know what will happen, why to leave the house. But if we open our minds, we stop our thoughts and analysis, we will surely have a day full of surprises, transformations and wonderful things.\nIt is not easy to do this, because our mind is programmed to anticipate things and avoid what we do not like. But it is not easy, nor do continuous and statistical analysis all day. It’s about choosing between stagnating and developing yourself. About looking at the world with other eyes, curious and wide open.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":8,"image":"images/blog/labels-cliches-statistics.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"We live with a statistical mindset.

Why are we not aware, besides the benefits, of the shortcomings of some tools, skills learned? Are things only in black or white?\nConcepts such as “positive thinking”, “personal development” are overrated by some and underrated by others. While they can be useful only if we look at them in terms of balance.\nPositive Thinking / Negative Thinking In terms of positive thinking, if we see everything in pink it will probably be of no use to us. We won’t even notice the pit beneath feet. But if we treat everything with a negative attitude we will not see the beautiful side of things and we will be demotivated. Perhaps it would be better to find a balance in which to analyze the situation we are in? With the help of positive thinking, we can channel it towards success, taking into account the possible risks. That way we will feel more confident about the situation and have a clear picture of what should happen.\nPersonal Development In terms of personal development, if you devour any information and learn skills at random, get to a point where you realize that you know a lot, but do nothing in what you know. And vice versa, if you just act and not develop you will feel that you cannot pass a certain level no matter how much you try. It’s not about what you can do, but about what you think you can do. Here balancing would mean applying what you learn consistently, only then will the mind synergize with the action and the results will be visible.\nBalance The balance in this case, is not a fixed state to reach, it is rather a state of continuous evolution in harmony. We can imagine balance as a situation where you have two glass bowls that you have to fill with some balls. Each time you receive only one little ball and you can place them one at a time in each of them. It can never happen that those two bowls have the same number of balls. Nor to be greater distance between them than one. In the case of personal development it would be: the first bowl for development and the second for action. And in the case of positive thinking would be: the first bowl for positive thinking and the second for measuring risks.\nTo many and colorful balls! 🙂\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art TanyMindsArt.com\n","id":9,"image":"images/blog/pozitive-thinking-negative-thinking-tany-minds.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"Why are we exaggerating?

As in life, everything is relative and depends on the perception of each individual. For someone the size of a business means how many employees it has, for someone else whose turnover, for others what profit and there are those for whom business value for people matters.\nThe most important thing is what the creator wants from his business. There are many analysts around: neighbors, consultants, marketers, godparents and other stakeholders 🙂 who are interested in the size of your business. Each of them have well-defined criteria of life experience and accumulated knowledge of what a business means. Everyone has the right to an opinion. And it is possible that everyone is right in their own way. But owning a business is like any other profession, it fulfills those who have it, some financial but also psychological needs. If you take into account all the experts it is possible on the way to lose the ability to extract from this occupation the pleasure, the fulfillment.\nWe should not report each business to those with imposing dimensions. Bill Gates saw his huge business from the beginning, “bring in every home a computer”, otherwise he couldn’t imagine, so he created what he created. But there are entrepreneurs who see their creations differently, do not want to change humanity, just want to bring value to a community for example, or create jobs, others want to get financial freedom, others just like to be creative.\nAfter all, the size depends on the eye of the one who sees it, not on the value itself. Entrepreneurs should focus on what they do and what they want, not on criteria imposed by society. If the most successful creators had been influenced by society, the society would have been deprived of many things that it enjoys today and takes them as a given.\nDefinition “Stakeholders” – Stakeholders in an organization are individuals and constituents who contribute, voluntarily or involuntarily, to the creation of values and are potential beneficiaries of profit or risk.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art https://tanymindsart.com\r","id":10,"image":"images/blog/size-matter-business-and-creator.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"It all depends on the person interested.

Entrepreneurship is a perfect amplifier of anxiety. It is the step that, when you do it, you remain free but alone, most often. Even if it seems that freedom is something that frees you from worry, it is quite the opposite. Freedom comes with a lot of responsibilities, a lot of uncertainty and from here it is the direct path to anxiety.\nChange is hard Living in continuous change is hard. You always have to adapt things, and yourself, for tomorrow. And no boss to tell you which steps to follow and no corporate system that measures everything and guides you. You have to do everything yourself, research the direction of the market, write down your steps, if you are more organized to create your own system. At first glance it seems impossible, you cannot be a researcher, creator and strategist at the same time. But we have clear examples of successful entrepreneurs who have done more at the same time. But Satisfaction of success is a huge one, entrepreneurs know why. Even if you work hard, you do it when you want, as you want, at the pace you want. Of course, the reward is proportional to the effort, but this is your choice.\nAnxiety is part of the challenge Anxiety during this time is paying close attention to details, the more details appear the more space for maneuver have in your head. What if we became friends with her? Or maybe we can even begin to tolerate it, to make it aware, and to allow it to exist. However, she is the one who creates our challenges. Every entrepreneur loves challenges, business is a challenge in itself. Anxiety is part of the challenge, without it we would not have the courage to solve them. When can you still be brave if not when you are afraid? Anxiety can cause us to act, try new things, make changes or crouch in a corner and complain of pity. What we do is just our choice.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Tany Minds Art TanyMindsArt.com\n","id":11,"image":"images/blog/anxiety-and-business-tany-minds.jpg","section":"blog","summary":"It may seem strange, but these two concepts are closely linked.

The painter makes many attempts until he reaches the final result. But he doesn’t start a new canvas every time, he just adds and straightens what doesn’t suit him. In this case, some colors and shapes can only be obtained in this way. If someone makes a copy, the painting may look perfect but lack substance, the colors may not be as deep or simply not emanate the initial energy given by the author.\nOwn trials It is the same in life, we repeat the teachings of others step by step, but something does not happen. Something is always not as we expected. Of course, we cannot repeat the whole process that others have gone through with their mistakes. But we have the possibility to adapt these patterns to our situation, to go through them, to make our mistakes, to readjust, to add our own steps or to modify them. In this way the picture of our life will vibrate in its own colors, beautiful and special. And most importantly unique!

Okay, but what would be the next step? Maybe ”Why do we want to take the ten steps? ”or maybe“ What is success actually for each of us?”.\nTools for developing a successful business or life There are many tools for developing a successful business or life, but do you need all these tools to grow? Is it necessary to have a sales funnel for each company? Are anyone’s strategies valid in your life? Maybe we should learn to ask ourselves questions. To learn to adapt all the knowledge of the situation we are in, not others. Maybe from the “ten steps for” we need only two or in addition to the ten we need to add three more.\nIt is a stage where we are drawn to the patterns we learn from each other and apply them without realizing that it is not our puzzle. Sometimes the solution is simpler than you think it is, sometimes the solution is to do nothing. It’s hard to believe, but there are also times when you have to leave the time and actions of the past to make it work. We are in a hurry, expect immediate results, but no seed will emerge per minute and all the more it will not grow suddenly.\nLet it happen Maybe we should start looking at time differently, maybe we should allow it to run. We take the actions we need, but we shouldn’t get into a state of constant waiting that stresses us. Because of the permanent state of haste we make mistakes, and it is not a matter of reality, but why we feel and think, in turn, what we think affects what we do. We do not allow the seed to grow, we pour too much water and we rot or abandon it for many other seeds, and when it had to make the growth, it also dried.\nIf you’ve done everything that is up to you, relax, allow time to place them in their places, if you stress the time, he becomes ruthless with you. And the effect of mutual blaming (accusation) appears. Blame it on time but somewhere in the subconscious you know you are guilty. Here comes the feeling of guilt that is the cruelest of all. And the main cause of closed circuits. If the guilt appears you always take it from the beginning, you go through your mind through all the times of failure, you become demotivated and tired.\nStay connected The reality is much simpler, that’s why it’s called reality, it doesn’t need too many interpretations.
